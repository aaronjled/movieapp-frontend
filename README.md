Made using React, JavaScript, PGAdmin4, Django, HTML, CSS, GitHub and hosted on Heroku.

This app is meant to allow the cataloguing of movies, and allow users to list movies, rate them, and eventually search for them and sort them. Next steps in the app were to style, and create users to hold individual lists on their pages for editing. 

currently there is one list that can be added to, edited, and deleted by anyone. The stretch goal is to add movie style posters as well as limit lists to individual members.
